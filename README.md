## Summary
#### This is a simple SwitchBot, SwitchBot Curtain, SwitchBot Meter operation commands. You don't have to know anything about Bluetooth specifications to use this. The only thing you need to know is the MAC address of the SwitchBot device. Recently one of my friends bought a SwitchBot product, and I was using it for my house IoT project for a while, so I brushed up the code and decided to share it.
